# NST


Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a technique that combines the content of one image with the style of another. Here are the detailed steps to perform NST using TensorFlow:

1. Import Libraries

2. Load Content and Style Images

3. Preprocess the content and style images. This typically involves resizing them to a consistent size and normalizing pixel values.

4. Choose layers in a pre-trained convolutional neural network (e.g., VGG19) that will be used to capture content and style information.

5. Create a new model that takes the content and style images as input and outputs feature representations from the chosen layers.

6. Calculate the content loss, which measures the difference in content between the generated image and the content image. This is typically done by computing the mean squared error between feature maps from the content layers.

7. Calculate the style loss, which measures the difference in style between the generated image and the style image. This involves computing the Gram matrices of feature maps from the style layers and finding the mean squared error between these Gram matrices.

8. Add a total variation loss term to encourage spatial smoothness in the generated image.

9. Combine the content loss, style loss, and total variation loss using weighting factors to create the total loss.

10. Initialize the generated image as a copy of the content image or as random noise.
Use an optimizer (e.g., Adam) to minimize the total loss by adjusting the generated image.

11. Iteratively update the generated image to minimize the total loss over multiple iterations.

12. Periodically display or save the generated image to visualize the progress of style transfer.

13. Adjust hyperparameters like content and style weights, learning rate, and the number of iterations to achieve the desired result.

14. Clip pixel values to be in the valid range (usually 0-255) and ensure the data type is appropriate for image display (e.g., convert to uint8).

15. Display the final stylized image and save it to disk.
These are the high-level steps involved in performing Neural Style Transfer using TensorFlow.
